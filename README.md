Node.js and React are two of the most powerful tools in the JavaScript ecosystem. In this tutorial, we use Strapi for Node.js content management and strap it to a React frontend, resulting in a full JS SPA.

Steps:

- Setting up a Node.js backend for Strapi with MongoDB.
- Creating appropriate content types in Strapi for the SPA.
- Building a React SPA (a basic online shop) with create-react-app.
- Bundling & deploying the Universal JS app!

In the process, I reflected a lot about this kind of Universal JavaScript stack and its place in the developer's space.
